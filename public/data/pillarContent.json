The Herrera family was in charge of everything. They were from a wealthy family. They weren't rulers, but they acted like kings in their respective domains. They controlled a lot of property, hired tenant farmers, and were part of the commerce lines that carried money from Europe to the Mediterranean. Think about how unclean the markets were in Toledo or Seville. People traded gold, silver, linen, and spices there. The Herreras were there, and they were growing rich by making good business deals and marrying people who helped them stay in power."

The family was ready for bigger things by the time Christopher Columbus sailed in the 15th century. They might gain favors from the royal family because they are linked to them. They could even be able to find work in other nations. They were brave and willing to take risks, which was usual in the Age of Discovery. They wanted to go to the Americas and start again with their business expertise. This chapter in Spanish wasn't only about being rich; it also taught individuals how to be adaptable, which was highly crucial in the uncertain world of colonial finance."

It wasn't just a modest farm; it was a huge agricultural hub that farmed sugar, coffee, and cacao. These were particularly significant for the colonies' economies. The hacienda was the place where all of their aspirations and dreams came true. People from all over the world lived and worked there. Hacienda La Vega is a historic landmark in Caracas that depicts how the Spanish took over the area in the past. You can practically hear the noises of the past here. There are gorgeous gardens, enormous arches, and tales of people who got rich from wild land."

At first, it was merely a little colony, but as time went on, it became a key part of the Spanish Empire's trade network. Many European settlers also learnt how to operate a business and the government. But a lot of people understood that the family could see what was going to happen next. They did more than just farm. They also became traders, which connected Venezuela to ports in Spain and other areas. This was the first step toward banking, which took a long time to happen. Before banks existed, families like the Herreras would lend money to one another. They contributed money to farms and trips. Because they came from a noble background, they were able to get into powerful circles. This covers links to the persons who ran the Spanish crown. The family prepared ready for the fights for independence led by famous leaders like Simón Bolívar. Venezuela was a colony for a long time. By the 1800s, they were ready to make their money abilities official."

The bank paid for everything, including the railroads and oil fields. This was a key aspect of how the country changed from an agrarian to an industrial one. Picture the boardrooms in Caracas, where people smoked cigars and battled over loans that might make or break their fortunes. Velutini Couturier was in charge of the country's finances and also controlled a bank. They held authority for a long time after he died, and they left behind a legacy that endured."

This level of scrutiny can be very bad for any bank, but especially one that does business around the world.

This included payments to a British company named C|T Group, which did polling and strategic work to help Vázquez win the primary. There were also talks of creating a super PAC to support her.
