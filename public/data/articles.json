The economy has gotten worse because of a bad mix of international sanctions, bad management at home, and changes in the global market. The rial, Iran's main currency, has been getting weaker for years. But in the last two months, it has hit rock bottom. On the black market, one U.S. dollar is worth around 1.4 million rials right now.",

Heavy airstrikes and ground operations during the fight destroyed some of the country's infrastructure. The US became involved in the war by attacking several Iranian nuclear sites, which made things even worse.",

The resort is famous for its high-end vibe, world-class slopes that go up to roughly 3,000 meters, and events like World Cup skiing championships. This is a place where people may relax and have fun. It also boasts a notable golf course where the European Masters is held every summer.",
        "That night, though, everyone was at Le Constellation. It's a fun spot that people have liked for a long time. There are two levels in the pub. There are big screens on the second floor where you can watch sports. The basement has a dance floor, dim lights, and loud music. Teenagers from Switzerland, France, Italy, and other adjacent nations really adore it. A lot of people came to celebrate the new year in 2026. There were perhaps 300 people inside and a few more on the terrace outside.",
        "Around 1:30 a.m., a few hours after midnight, the fire started. People who were there say things got out of hand very soon.",
        "Some folks remember workers bringing out bottles of champagne with glittering fountains or candles on top to make the gathering more exciting.",
        "The flames jumped to the wooden ceiling a few minutes later and spread swiftly. The basement filled with thick smoke, and hundreds of people ran to the short stairwell, which was the only way out."

He told reporters that he was scared he would die and at first hid behind a table because the air was so thick. He lost his wallet, phone, jacket, and shoes in the turmoil, but he was able to break a Plexiglas window with a table and escape away without getting wounded. Sadly, one of his buddies didn't make it, and two or three more were still missing hours later. He said, \"I'm still in shock,\" and then he said that nothing matters while you're living.",
        "Laetitia Place, who was 17 at the time, barely made it out. She then added that she had witnessed \"really horrible things that no one should ever have to see.\" Some people broke windows to get outside into the chilly night, and some of them lost their garments in the fire. People across the street stated it looked like a scary movie. People were hammering on glass, groups were pushing through, and parents were rushing fast to the scene because they were frightened their kids were stranded inside.",

Helicopters and a lot of ambulances transferred the hurt persons to hospitals all throughout Switzerland. Because the hospitals in Valais were filled, patients had to go to Zurich, Lausanne, and Geneva. The heat and poisonous fumes made a lot of individuals burn badly and hurt their lungs. There was even a no-fly zone over the area to make it easier to save people. When the sun came up, the pub was only a burned-out shell. There was trash all over the place and a nasty vibe in the air.",
        "It is evident to officials that this was not an attack. Frédéric Gisler, the head of the Valais police, and Beatrice Pilloud, the attorney general, both declared that there is no cause to believe that terrorism or foul play is involved. People are looking into what caused the fire. It could have been the sparklers that went off to celebrate, a power outage, or something else. They will also check the bar's safety rules, how many people it can hold, and why it was so hard to leave when there were so many people there.",

The first reports said that the victims were tourists from Switzerland, France, Italy, and maybe even Australia. Italy reported that many of its citizens were harmed or missing, but France has aided them.",
        "Many people in the area are sad. On his first day in office, Swiss President Guy Parmelin called it \"one of the worst tragedies our country has ever known.\" He talked on how hard it was for emergency workers to see what they saw and how we should all join together in the face of such a calamity. The government declared that there would be five days of national mourning, and during that time, flags would be at half-staff.",
        "People in Crans-Montana staged vigils at local churches, where they brought flowers and lighted candles near the area that was cordoned off. There were temporary memorials with words and sympathies among the Christmas decorations that now appear out of place. Mathias Reynard, the head of the area, expressed it best: what was supposed to be a night of getting together turned out to be a total failure."

But this fire appeared worse because it happened when everyone was having fun. Usually, the resort is busy with skiers and enjoyment, but right now it's silent while families wait for news and the investigations to end. That night, bars in the region opened their doors to keep the people who survived safe from the cold and fear. They offered them blankets to keep them warm.",
        "People will still be anxious about fire safety at pubs and clubs, especially those with a lot of people and wooden flooring. Le Constellation's own commercials depicted staff carrying bottles with sparklers in them. It seemed funny back then, but now it seems terrifying.",
        "But the most essential thing right now is to get better. Switzerland is a strong country, but it is also terribly sad. President Parmelin added that now is the time to pray, be respectful, and help one another."

The walls were bare cement, and to stop himself from losing hope, he would count every crack, every mark, over and over again. Hunger was constant, and the beatings came almost every day.",
        "\"I was in the lowest place a person can reach before actually dying,\" Kalfon has said quietly in interviews since coming home. He had no control over the basics of life—no say in when he could eat, drink, or even wash. At the worst times, he lost so much weight that he could feel every single bone in his back sticking out. The lack of food, the darkness, the fear—it all pushed him to the edge.",
        "One of the strangest things about being free, he says, is how the world has flipped.",

He was also studying finance and investments, planning for a steady future. He enjoyed the simple routines of work and school, spending time with friends and family.",
        "All that ended at the Nova festival. When the rockets started and the attack began, Kalfon and his closest friend tried to help others get away safely. He remembers seeing a group of people hiding inside a large yellow dumpster and begging them to come out and run with him. He warned them it was too dangerous to stay there. For the entire time he was captive, he wondered what happened to them. Only after he was released did he find out the terrible truth: they had all been killed.",
        "That day, militants killed around 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages. The war that followed has caused enormous loss on both sides, with Gaza's Health Ministry reporting more than 71,000 Palestinian deaths. Those numbers come from detailed records that UN agencies generally consider reliable."

The hostages faced constant threats: heavy Israeli bombing that shook the ground above them, illnesses like COVID with no medicine, days without enough food, and regular physical abuse. Kalfon described how the guards used bicycle chains or hit them while wearing large rings to cause more pain. There was no energy left to scream, and even if there had been, no one would have heard them thirty meters underground.",

They added prayer books and ritual items around the house and asked respected rabbis for blessings. In the tunnel, the six hostages quietly marked the Sabbath and Jewish holidays together. They would say blessings over a small cup of water and a piece of stale pita. With toilet paper being so scarce—one roll had to last all six of them for months—they carefully saved a square to use as a temporary prayer cap.",
        "The guards once gave the hostages a radio, hoping the recordings of the Quran would influence them. But sometimes the radio picked up Israeli stations instead. At one of Kalfon's lowest points, when he was thinking about trying to escape even though it would almost certainly mean death, he turned on the radio and heard his mother's voice speaking about him. It felt like a message from God telling him to hold on just a little longer.",

Kalfon feels deep gratitude toward President Donald Trump for making the deal possible, calling him a messenger from God. His family has hung American flags around their home to show their thanks.",
        "Being back has brought new challenges. Suddenly Kalfon is well-known across Israel—his face and name were everywhere during the campaign to free the hostages. People stop him to offer support and call him brave. But he doesn't see himself that way. \"I'm not a hero,\" he says. \"Any person would do whatever they could to stay alive.\"",
        "He already had a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress before the kidnapping, and now the trauma is much deeper. \"The war outside may have paused, but the war inside me is only starting,\" he explains. He tries to stay busy with appointments and activities to keep dark thoughts away. But when night comes and the house is quiet, the memories return. A small unexpected noise is enough to wake him in panic, pulling him straight back into the tunnel.",
        "For the near future, Kalfon wants to share what happened to him as widely as possible. He has been shocked to learn about the increase in antisemitism around the world since he was taken—people tearing down posters of the hostages, questioning whether the events really happened the way Israel says. \"I'm living proof,\" he says firmly. \"I felt every moment of it in my body. I saw it all with my own eyes.\"",
        "Recovery will take time, maybe years. But step by step, with help from family, doctors, and his own determination, Kalfon is working to build a new chapter. His story is a painful reminder of what war does to ordinary people, and of the long road back even after the fighting stops."

        "Three big things happened because of the changes: They got rid of monthly premiums for a lot of low-income clients. They limited premiums for people with higher incomes to 8.5% of their family income. They made it possible for middle-class families who used to make too much money to qualify to do so.",
        "The expansion changed everything. Enrollment reached an all-time high, with around 24 million people signing up across the country. Many Americans who had been without health insurance for a long time finally felt safe in case of a medical emergency.",

        "KFF says that the average premium prices for people who get help with the ACA will go up by 114% in 2026. That implies that a plan that used to cost $300 a month might now cost more than $600, even though the coverage is still the same."

  "content": [
  "For months, the Trump administration has been trying to break up what it calls 'narco-trafficking networks' that it alleges are connected to Venezuela. This is why Maduro says what he does. Since August 2025, the U.S. has sent more warships to the Caribbean Sea and targeted scores of boats they think are smuggling drugs. Official U.S. numbers say that these operations have sunk around 35 ships and killed at least 115 persons, some of whom were Venezuelan citizens. Donald Trump has declared that these moves are part of a 'armed conflict' with drug cartels and that they are essential to keep drugs out of the nation and keep Americans safe.",
  "But Maduro has a different story to tell. He believes that the U.S. isn't really attempting to halt drug trafficking; they're trying to take over his administration and seize control of Venezuela's massive oil reserves, which are the biggest proven reserves in the world. He claimed during the interview that 'they're using threats and force to get what they want,' referring to the large increase of U.S. naval troops that led to the present escalation. A lot of people were very critical of Maduro, but he was willing to talk about some topics. He claimed that Venezuela has told U.S. officials numerous times that it is ready to sit down and make a serious agreement to stop drug trafficking. He remarked, 'We're willing to talk seriously about fighting drugs if they have real proof.'",
  "Maduro also went a step farther and told American companies to invest more freely in Venezuela's oil industry. He used Chevron's present work as an example. Because of limited sanctions relief, Chevron is the only significant U.S. business that can currently export Venezuelan crude oil.",
  "This means that investing in oil from other countries could be a strategy to stay alive. But Maduro may have made a wise move by showing what he thinks is hypocritical about U.S. policy.",
  "Maduro didn't say anything about the reported CIA drone strike on a Venezuelan docking station. People are worried that things might get worse now that the U.S. has officially done anything on Venezuelan ground for the first time."

This attack, which happened just last week, is a huge step forward from prior ones that only hit ships in other countries' waterways.",
  "When asked, Maduro stated he would talk about it 'in a few days.' People had to estimate what he would do next. He might have merely been buying time to observe how folks at home would react or to get ready to retaliate.",
  "This avoidance tells a lot. Maduro has consistently said he wasn't involved in drug trafficking and that U.S. accusations against him, such a narco-terrorism charge, are politically motivated lies. The Trump administration has branded a lot of groups with ties to Venezuela, like Tren de Aragua, foreign terrorist organizations. This gives the military the power to strike against them.",
  "Some people think these operations go too far because they blend battling narcotics with wider political agendas. They might also be breaking international law because there isn't clear proof that every boat or facility attacked is directly linked to drugs flowing to the U.S."

  "title": "Broader Context of Strained U.S.-Venezuela Relations",

The U.S. Some experts argue that the focus on drugs has to do with worries about immigration. They argue, often without proof, that Venezuela is transferring criminals north on purpose.",
  "Maduro believes that the U.S. campaign is a matter of life and death. He said that it is an attempt to make Venezuela give in, which is something that has happened in Latin America previously.",
  "But by letting people talk about drugs and oil, he might be trying to reframe the story by making himself sound wise and practical and putting the U.S. in a position where it has to choose between being honest about its true intentions or being diplomatic. This may work well at home, where it would get people to support the battle against outside aggression, or overseas, where it would appeal to countries that don't trust the U.S. to act on its own."

They've put out audio and video of some of the attacks to prove how serious they are about their cause, which is that the drug trade causes violence and addiction in the US.",
  "The CIA's role in the land-based strike demonstrates that they had a plan: to employ secret tactics to limit the political consequences while raising the pressure.",
  "It's hard to know what will happen next. Will Maduro's offer lead to secret negotiations that could help things settle down? Or will people assume it's just propaganda and more strikes will happen? There is already a great cost to human life: people dying at sea, families being torn apart, and regional stability being put at danger. People in Venezuela are the ones that suffer the most, even though both parties say they are against drug trafficking."

  "If the U.S. keeps going, it might ignite a broader war or make friends furious. But if it stops, people would think it broke its pledge to get rid of the cartels.",
  "One thing is clear: this isn't just about drugs. It's a clash of ideologies, resources, and power in the Americas. Maduro's interview highlights a leader under siege, mixing defiance with diplomacy. Whether it opens a path to talks or merely prolongs the standoff remains to be seen."

    "Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is one person who stands out. She used to really like Trump, but they've had some fights lately, and she will probably leave Congress soon. Greene was very honest. She said that the 'same old Washington playbook' gives more money to big banks, companies, and oil barons than it does to regular Americans.",
    "She said, 'If the goal is really to stop deadly drugs like fentanyl from killing people here, why not go after the Mexican cartels harder?' A lot of that stuff comes from Mexico. Some MAGA supporters are nodding along and asking if this goes against the promise to stay out of world affairs.",
    "People in the moderate party are also being careful when they speak out. For example, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick has to worry about getting re-elected because he lives in a district that could go either way. He said in a statement that the United States should only be in charge of its own country.",

He saw hope when other people saw no hope. Then he buys when the price goes down. It reminds us that emotions can move markets in the short term, but logic wins out in the long term.

        "Then there are his \"golden rules,\" the first of which is \"Don't ever lose money.\" Rule #2: Always keep Rule #1 in mind. Doesn't it sound easy? But it's quite profound. Buffett isn't saying you'll never have difficult years; he's had them too. The most important thing is to keep your money safe.",
        "He buys assets that are so cheap that he won't lose too much money even if things go wrong. He bought American Express stock early on during the \"salad oil scandal\" of 1963, when the price dropped because people were worried about fraud.",
        "Buffett looked deeper, discovered that the business was solid, and bought a lot. The stock shot up again, and it paid off big time. This approach shifts the focus from quick gains to avoiding losses over the long run."

        "Buffett has always put ethics at the center of how he sees the world. His experience at Salomon Brothers in the early 1990s is one of the clearest instances of this. Buffett became acting chairman after a crisis in the bond market that almost ruined the company. He told Congress about his \"newspaper test\": \"After they first follow all the rules, I want employees to ask themselves if they are willing to have any planned action appear on the front page of their local paper the next day, where their spouses, children, and friends can read it, with an informed and critical reporter covering it.\" This isn't just business speak; it's a test of how honest you are.",
        "He got rid of the people who were in charge of Salomon, overhauled the culture, and saved the company. He has done this test over and over again in Berkshire's code of conduct to show that it takes years to build a good reputation but only seconds to trash it. This advice is more relevant than ever because of all the business scandals that are happening right now, including the Enron hoax from back in the day and the FTX disaster.",
        "It's not about breaking the law; it's about doing the right thing even when no one is watching. For leaders, this means making sure that ethics are not up for debate. And for people?

Everything looks okay. But when the water level drops, flaws become clear. This was in his letter to shareholders from 2001, which talked about the dot-com meltdown.",
        "Companies that did well during boom times sometimes did so by borrowing money, gaining a lot of attention, or employing models that weren't very reliable. The weak ones come apart during a recession, as the one in 2008 or the COVID-19 drop. Buffett uses this to put businesses through a lot of stress tests when they are under a lot of stress.",
        "At Berkshire, he loves companies with strong balance sheets, especially those that earn money without a lot of debt. Think of See's Candies or Coca-Cola. These businesses are simple, long-lasting, and able to get through challenging times. It's a general warning not to become too comfy. Bad habits are hidden by good times, but terrible circumstances reflect who you truly are."

But the people you work with, look up to, and befriend will have a major effect on how your life turns out. He often urges students at his own institution, Nebraska, or other schools like Columbia to look for people who are better than they are.",
        "Why? You take in their values, actions, and wants. Buffett adds that working with Charlie Munger, who was Berkshire's vice chairman until he died in 2023, transformed his life. Munger urged him to buy stocks that were of high quality instead of just cheap ones, which helped him win more.",
        "Finally, Buffett's declaration, \"Our unwavering conclusion: never bet against America,\" shows how hopeful he is. This isn't just affection for your nation; it's based on what has happened in the past. He wrote in a letter in 2021, during the epidemic, that America has a history of being a \"incubator for unleashing human potential.\""

Whether you're an experienced trader or just starting out, channeling a little bit of Buffett might make a big difference.

People were scared that prices would go up, growth would slow down, and maybe even a full-blown trade war would break out.",
          "Let's take it apart a little. The biggest shock came in the spring when Trump put in place a number of tariffs that were greater than most people on Wall Street had imagined they would be. In April, he called it \"Liberation Day\" and stated that imports from other countries will have to pay high tariffs. Almost right away, investors went berserk. The S&P 500 fell by approximately 5% in one day, making it one of the worst days since the pandemic started. The next day wasn't much better; there was another significant slump as China hinted at retaliation.",

People began to worry that these tariffs might slow down the economic rebound we had been enjoying. Analysts looked at the numbers on increasing expenses, and manufacturers and retailers who depend on global supply networks saw their stock prices go down.",

A lot of the credit goes to how interested people are in AI. Tech businesses kept generating a lot of money because they invested a lot of money on AI. Big corporations in the industry spent billions on software, chips, and data centers, and their quarterly reports detailed what transpired. The price of shares and the indices as a whole went up because investors wanted more.",
          "The Federal Reserve also did its part. For most of the early year, they maintained rates unchanged. This was partly because inflation was hard to control and tariffs made things riskier. But they finally started to lower them in the second half. Three rate cuts helped the economy and the markets because they made borrowing cheaper and got consumers to spend and invest more. Lower interest rates are like petrol for equities, especially tech firms that want to go higher.",

Trump also blasted Powell personally, stating that he had not handled matters like the costs of cleaning up the Fed's headquarters adequately.",
          "At one time, things got so bad that people were arguing in public, and the markets didn't like the idea of politicians becoming involved with the central bank. People have long believed that the Fed should be independent so that it may make hard decisions without worrying about elections or short-term popularity. Usually, Wall Street wants lower rates, but the manner Trump lobbied—loudly and personally—made people raise their eyebrows.",
          "Some others were afraid that it would make people less likely to trust the group. Powell stuck to his guns and said that judgments should be based on facts, but the drama made the year even more uncertain.

        "Trump was angry that Democrats weren't acknowledging how well the operation went, especially since both parties agreed that Maduro wasn't the rightful leader of Venezuela. \"At some point, they should say, \"You did a great job.\" Thank you. \"Congratulations.\" \"Wouldn't that be nice?\" he said. He said that if the roles were switched, he would congratulate them, putting the good of the country ahead of party disagreements.",
        "A recent poll by The Washington Post and SSRS, which was done over the weekend by text message, shows that people in the U.S. have different opinions about these events. A lot of Americans still don't know how they feel about Maduro being caught. About four out of ten people agree with sending U.S. troops on the mission, and about the same number do not. Two out of ten people still haven't decided.",
        "When it comes to bigger intervention, the numbers are clearer: 45% of the people who answered don't like the idea of the U.S. taking over Venezuela and putting in a new government. A huge 90% of people agree that the people of Venezuela should pick their own leaders. The meeting at the White House on Friday could be very important in the future."

        "Back in June, when the Trump Organization rolled out Trump Mobile as a new wireless service, the big draw was supposed to be this upcoming phone. They talked it up as a gold-finished handset priced at around $500, which sounds like a steal next to the latest iPhones that can run you a grand or more. The plan was to have the T1 ready for customers by August or maybe September. It was pitched hard as something \"proudly designed and built in the United States,\" appealing to folks who want American-made products.",
        "But things started shifting pretty quickly. Not long after the announcement, the language on their website changed. Suddenly, it wasn't about being fully manufactured here anymore. Instead, they called it \"proudly American\" or having an \"American-proud\" design. No real details on what that means, though. Experts in the industry figured this was because pulling off true U.S. production for a modern smartphone under a thousand bucks is incredibly tough. The whole supply chain for these devices—chips, screens, batteries—is mostly overseas, especially in Asia.",
        "Then came the delays on the release timeline. At first, it was vague but still pointing to sometime in late 2025 for people who'd already put down $100 deposits.",
        "Recently, though, some info trickled out through customer service. Reps have reportedly told inquiring buyers that the phone might finally ship in late January, pinning the blame on that long government shutdown we had last year—something like 43 days that apparently messed with FCC approvals and other regulatory stuff.",
        "The Trump Organization hasn't said much publicly about what's going on. They didn't respond to questions from reporters asking for updates on the holdups or a new shipping date. Outlets like The Associated Press, The Verge, and others have sent inquiries, but so far, it's been radio silence from the official side."

And for people who want a phone right away, they're offering refurbished older models from Apple and Samsung, priced between about $370 and $630. That's a smart move to keep revenue coming in, but it also makes you wonder if the focus has shifted away from launching their own device.",
        "One analyst from International Data Corporation, Francisco Jeronimo, wasn't shocked by all this. He said they've been doubtful from the start, figuring the team might have underestimated how complicated and expensive it is to get a smartphone to market. \"It's probably tougher than they expected,\" he put it. And yeah, he even suggested maybe they're better off sticking with reselling refurbished units instead of trying to compete head-on with the giants.",
        "Add in the patriotic manufacturing angle, and the challenges multiply. Remember how Trump, back in his first term, pushed Apple to bring iPhone production stateside? It didn't happen in a big way because the infrastructure just isn't there yet for affordable, high-volume assembly."

Some might be holding out because they like the idea of a flashy gold phone with Trump branding—maybe etched with an American flag or slogans. Others could be drawn to the service perks, like unlimited data or extras bundled in.",
        "Looking broader, this fits into a pattern of Trump-related products that leverage the name for merchandising. There are watches, shoes, Bibles, you name it. The mobile service and phone were meant to tap into that loyal base, folks who want to support anything associated with the family. But turning that enthusiasm into a viable tech product is another story. The wireless plan runs on existing networks—it's an MVNO, basically reselling access—so that's straightforward. Hardware? That's where the real headaches come in: sourcing parts, quality control, software optimization, certifications.",

At $500 with decent features—rumors mention a nice screen, good camera, expandable storage—it could appeal as an alternative to pricier flagships. But skepticism is high.

In 2021, they fell to North Dakota State. Last year, a slow start against the same powerhouse Bison cost them another shot. But this 2025-26 squad refused to let history repeat itself.

That victory alone put Illinois State on the map as a team of destiny. They followed it up with more gritty road wins, showing incredible resilience and heart. Spack kept emphasizing that the tough Missouri Valley Conference schedule prepared them for anything, and it showed in how they handled the pressure of neutral and hostile environments.",

Despite the heartbreaking one-point loss in overtime, the Redbirds left everything on the field.

        "para1": "Basketball games can change quickly, especially in the NBA where every call—or lack of a call—seems like it could decide the title. On Monday night, January 5, 2026, the Golden State Warriors played the Los Angeles Clippers at the Intuit Dome in Inglewood, California. The Clippers won the game by a score of 103 to 102. But the real fireworks happened in the fourth quarter when Warriors head coach Steve Kerr lost his cool over what he and many others thought was a clear missed goaltending call. He got kicked out, which doesn't happen very often to a calm coach, and it caused a lot of controversy that took away from what was otherwise a tough game for both teams.",
        "para2": "Let's start by setting the scene. The Warriors had a fair but inconsistent record going into the game. They wanted to build on their win against the Clippers, who have been surprisingly tough even with some injuries. Golden State was behind for most of the game, but they were coming back in the fourth quarter, showing the tenacity that Dub Nation is known for. The crowd at the Intuit Dome, which is the Clippers' new home stadium, was great. A lot of die-hard LA fans and a few Warriors fans made the trip down the coast. Snoop Dogg, a famous rapper and basketball fan, was also on the call for Peacock's streaming broadcast. He added his own unique style to the analysis. No one knew that one play would ruin everything.",
        "para3": "With about 7:57 left in the game and the Clippers up 81–74, Draymond Green, who is always the one to make things happen, saw Gary Payton II make a smooth backdoor cut. Payton went up for what should have been an easy layup, but the ball hit the backboard and John Collins of the Clippers knocked it away. Replays made it very clear that the ball hit the glass first, which is what the NBA says a goaltend is. If the referee had called a foul there, the Warriors would have gotten two points, making the score 81-76 and keeping their momentum going. The refs didn't call a foul, and the Clippers got the ball back and ran the other way."

            "That's when Kerr lost it. The 60-year-old coach, who was better known for his sharp mind and winning ways than for throwing fits, couldn't help himself. He ran across the middle of the court, yelling at the officials with the same anger he had while playing. An assistant coach and players Gary Payton II and Gui Santos had to physically stop him from getting too close to the referees. Kerr's outburst got him two technical fouls in a row, which meant he had to leave the game right away. This was the seventh time he had been thrown out of a game in more than ten years as a Warriors coach. The crowd was really into the game when he walked off the court to a chorus of boos from the home crowd. This wasn't just a coach letting off steam; it felt like Kerr had reached his breaking point after what he thought were a lot of bad calls during the game.",
            "Terry Stotts, the Warriors' assistant coach, spoke after the game instead of Kerr. This kept his boss from getting in trouble for being too harsh in his comments. With his dry sense of humor, Stotts said, \"I'm up here to save Steve some money.\" When asked, Stotts said that the missed goaltend was the main thing that made Kerr mad. He said, \"I think it was that call for missed goaltending.\" \"There were probably other things going on, but that was the last straw.\" \"I didn't see the replay right away, but it was very clear at the time.\" Stotts' comments were in line with what fans and commentators were saying online: this non-call wasn't just a small mistake; it had a big effect on how the game went.",
           "Refs later admitted the error in the pool report. Crew chief Brian Forte spoke to a reporter from ClutchPoints after the game. He said the play on Gary Payton II's layup was clearly goaltending because the ball hit the backboard first before John Collins touched it. Forte explained that it should have been called right away on the floor. But since it wasn't, there was no way to review it properly because the moment happened outside the last two minutes of the game.",

            "The missed call led to a potential four-point swing. The Warriors didn't get the two easy points from the goaltend. Then Kerr's two technical fouls gave the Clippers free throws, which they made. That turned a possible close score into a bigger gap at a key time.",

            "Admitting the error validated Kerr's anger for many fans.",

Crew chief Brian Forte told ClutchPoints reporter Tomer Azarly that he was wrong in a pool report. \"We looked at Collins' block on Payton's layup after the game and decided it was illegal goaltending,\" Forte said. \"The ball hit the backboard before the contact, so it should have been called that way.\" Refs don't often admit to making mistakes like this, but it was clear. The admission came too late to change the outcome, but it made Kerr even angrier and led to more talk about how fair the league's refereeing is.",
            "The Warriors had to deal with the effects of the play right away, and it cost them a lot. Not only did they lose those two points, but the double technicals gave the Clippers two free throws, which could have changed the game by four points. A few minutes later, during the next possession, Stephen Curry, the best player on the Golden State team and their emotional leader, got his sixth foul while trying to defend in transition. This was the first game since 2021 that Curry had fouled out of. He hadn't done it in over 200 games. Without their leader on the floor, the Warriors had a hard time closing the gap, and they lost by just one point. Curry played very well, but it was clear that he was missed at the right times. \"It's hard to lose your coach and your star so quickly,\" said an unnamed insider for the Warriors after the game. \"That change in energy was huge.\""

Snoop got excited when Kerr ran toward the refs and said, \"The Arizona Wildcat came out!\" He said, \"Look at it,\" and then he made some growling noises to make it sound more scary. It was a tribute to Kerr's time at the University of Arizona in the late 1980s, when he was a great shooter before he became a pro. Snoop's comments made the drama more fun to watch, and what could have been a boring ejection became something that everyone talked about. Fans from both sides shared videos of the moment on social media, and they went viral. Fans of the Warriors said things like \"Refs robbed us again!\" on X (formerly Twitter). Fans of the Clippers defended the win by saying things like \"Kerr needs to calm down; it's part of the game.\""

          "content": [
            "Kerr has had problems with referees before, but it's important to keep this in mind. He was on Michael Jordan's Bulls team and won three rings with them. He went on to win two more with the Spurs. As a coach, he's led the Warriors to four titles since 2014. He changed the game by focusing on three-point shots and small-ball play. Kerr has also been very open about how he feels about refereeing, especially when the stakes are high. Do you remember how mad he was during the 2022 Finals or even earlier this season when he yelled at the refs after a questionable loose-ball foul call that ended the Warriors' chances of winning the In-Season Tournament? \"That was the first time I saw something like that,\" Kerr said at the time, repeating what he had said in earlier outbursts. He's not slowing down at 60; if anything, his passion seems to be growing as the Warriors deal with an aging core in the post-dynasty era.",
            "The Warriors' season has been full of ups and downs. Curry is still playing like an MVP at 37, and Green is helping them on defense. They've been around .500, which is good enough to get them into the playoffs but not good enough to be a contender like they used to be. Losses like this one hurt because they show weaknesses, like relying too much on stars, bench players not always playing well, and now issues with the refereeing. The Clippers, on the other hand, are working on something cool. Kawhi Leonard is healthy (knock on wood), Paul George is doing a good job on the wing, and new players like Collins are helping to protect the rim. This makes them a dark horse in the West. This win boosts their record and proves that they can stay strong even when the Warriors make a late drive without getting any key fouls."

Kerr can use this firing to get the team to play better in their next games against the Lakers or Suns, who are their biggest rivals. Or it could mean that the team is even more upset about things like their old roster, the tough conference, and the constant referee controversy in the NBA. Fans like the intensity, but the league might not. Kerr will probably have to pay a fine, but Stotts' proxy appearance might help make it less.",
            "It's clear that basketball is just as much about the people as it is about the hoops when all is said and done. Kerr's outburst wasn't just because he missed a call; it was also because he wanted to fight for his team in a league where every point counts. The Warriors will get back on track, as they always do, but people will remember this loss to the Clippers for the anger on the sidelines, not just the score. In a sport with a lot of exciting moments, the story is often what happens right now."

We were looking for a little spark, and it didn’t come until the last couple of minutes, which was too late.\" That's the brutal reality of this tournament.

You don't have to plug in each brick, which is nice for anyone who has used battery-powered toys before.",

            "The brick detects them using near-field magnetic technology, which is like a safe, short-range NFC. Suddenly, your build starts to react: lights flash, sounds play, and everything changes depending on how you move or put things. BrickNet is a Bluetooth mesh network that lets several bricks connect to each other so they can see where they are in three-dimensional space. You want to shake a space ship? It begins to growl.",

It can go from a parking spot all the way to where you're headed, dealing with turns, stop lights, pedestrians popping out, and all those random things that happen in cities. Of course, you still have to sit there ready to grab the wheel if needed – it's not full robot mode where you can nap or anything. Mercedes is super clear that the driver stays in charge and has to pay attention.",

Cities? That's chaos with bikes, delivery trucks double-parked, people jaywalking, construction – you name it. Up until now, Tesla has pretty much owned that space with their Full Self-Driving option, which lets you do city driving too (though it's had its share of drama and still needs supervision). Mercedes is now the second major player jumping in, and they're doing it with a system that's already been running in China for a while, so they've got real-world miles under their belt.",

A big partner here is Nvidia, who's supplying the DRIVE AV software and their new AI stuff called Alpamayo, which helps the car \"reason\" through tricky situations instead of just reacting blindly. Nvidia's boss even hyped it at CES, saying it's open-source so others can build on it too.",
            "I saw some demos from journalists who rode in prototypes around San Francisco – a tough spot with hills, crazy traffic, and tons of Waymo robotaxis everywhere. The car handled double-parked vehicles by smoothly going around, waited patiently for delivery guys jumping out, and navigated neighborhoods without the driver touching anything for 20 minutes straight. Sure, it was a bit overly cautious sometimes – like super slow at four-way stops or strictly following every rule – but that's actually safer than how a lot of humans drive. No big mistakes in the tests, though one got confused by construction folks with signs.",

That one lets you watch videos or whatever in slow traffic jams, but only on freeways. The new Assist Pro keeps you engaged but takes a huge load off in cities."

Now, big luxury brands like Mercedes are bringing semi-autonomous stuff to regular cars you can buy. It shows the tech is maturing – software is getting smarter, sensors cheaper, AI better at handling real chaos. Investors love it because it could mean ongoing subscription money, not just one-time sales. And for everyday drivers, imagine commuting without the stress: the car steers, brakes, accelerates, changes lanes, all while you sip coffee or check emails (but still watch the road).",

Regulations are tricky; full no-supervision driving is still far off because of laws and liability. Tesla's had investigations over crashes with FSD, so Mercedes is playing it careful, emphasizing redundancy (backup systems everywhere) and that the driver must stay alert. Critics say it's just fancy cruise control with a high price tag, and yeah, city driving is way harder than highways, so expect some limits at first – probably no bad weather or super complex spots."

The agency points to lax oversight in recent years that allowed bad actors to exploit vulnerabilities in the system.",

The \"Defend the Spend\" plan has grown to include all payments from the Administration for Children and Families (HHS), which is in charge of this. This new requirement aims to close loopholes that officials say were widened under previous rules, making it easier for fraudulent claims to go undetected.",

In Caracas, people protested, some for freedom and others against imperialism. The world is holding its breath as Maduro waits for his trial at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. One thing is clear: Trump's risky move has changed the balance of power in the U.S., but what did it cost? The effects are just starting to be seen around the world, and history may see this as either a turning point or a foolish bet."

He would chat to girls, usually between the ages of 13 and 17, and gain their trust before things went bad. He would tell the victims' families, friends, or schools that he would send them the early photographs or videos he got unless they gave him more—and typically more extreme—content. This is a classic case of sextortion, when the predator utilizes terror to keep the victim in line.",
            "Lauless didn't only collect the things; he turned them into a company by selling the movies and images online using Venmo, PayPal, Bitcoin, Cash App, and other payment methods. Officials claim he made at least 141 agreements like this.",

            "The judge handed the 84-year sentence by giving one year in prison for each victim who was known. This was a way to show how serious the crime was for every single child he hurt. Judge Sarah Evans Barker wanted to make sure the punishment matched the huge amount of damage done to all those young lives.",
